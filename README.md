## Project Description: Credit Card Users Churn Prediction

### Business Context:
Thera Bank has recently experienced a significant decline in credit card users, which poses a threat to its revenue generated from various fees. Understanding why customers are leaving these services is crucial for the bank to mitigate losses and improve retention strategies.

### Objective:
My goal is to develop a classification model to predict which customers are likely to abandon their credit card services. By analyzing customer data, we aim to identify key factors contributing to churn, allowing the bank to enhance its services and retain valuable clients.

### Data Overview:
The dataset includes variables such as Client Number, Attrition Flag, Customer Age, Gender, Income Category, Credit Limit, and various transaction metrics. Key features, such as months inactive, total transaction amounts, and utilization ratios, will inform our model's predictions. By leveraging this data, we seek to provide actionable insights that can drive strategic improvements in customer engagement and service offerings.

This project aims to empower Thera Bank to foster customer loyalty and enhance overall satisfaction in their credit card services.
